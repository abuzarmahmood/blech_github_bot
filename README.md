## 🚀 Get Started in Minutes

### 1️⃣ Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/blech_github_bot.git
cd blech_github_bot
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# OR
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3️⃣ Install Everything You Need
```bash
# One command installs it all
make install

# Or install components separately
make install-deps  # Just Python dependencies
make install-aider # Just aider tool
```

### 4️⃣ Configure API Access
Create a `.env` file with your API tokens:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### 5️⃣ Tell Blech Bot What to Monitor
Add repositories to `config/repos.txt`:
```
owner/repo1
owner/repo2
```

### 6️⃣ Fine-tune Bot Behavior
Configure in `config/params.json`:
```json
{
    "auto_update": true
}
```
> **auto_update**: Set to `true` to keep your bot current with the latest features

### 7️⃣ Launch Your Bot
```bash
# Run once
python src/response_agent.py

# Or keep it running 24/7
./src/run_response_agent.sh --delay 300  # Check every 5 minutes
```

## 🔄 How It Works

```bash
python src/response_agent.py
```

### What Happens When You Run Blech Bot:

1. 🔗 **Connects to GitHub** using your secure API token
2. 📥 **Syncs repositories** to ensure it's working with the latest code
3. 🔍 **Scans for actionable issues** that:
   - Have the `blech_bot` label or "[ blech_bot ]" in the title
   - Need an initial response (new issues)
   - Have received user feedback (requiring follow-up)
   - Contain development commands (PR creation requests)
4. 💬 **Generates intelligent responses** powered by GPT-4o
5. 🌿 **Creates branches and PRs** when triggered with "[ develop_issue ]"
6. ✏️ **Implements code changes** automatically via Aider when feedback is received

### A Day in the Life of Blech Bot

#### 🛠️ Setup Phase
1. **Get Everything Ready**
   - Clone the repo and set up your environment
   - Configure your API tokens in `.env`
   - Add your repositories to `config/repos.txt`

#### 🚀 Launch Phase
2. **Start Your Assistant**
   ```bash
   python src/response_agent.py
   ```
   Or keep it running continuously:
   ```bash
   ./src/run_response_agent.sh --delay 300
   ```

#### 🔄 Working Phase
3. **Issue Analysis & Response**
   
   **User creates an issue:**
   > "[ blech_bot ] Feature Request: Add logging system for better debugging"
   
   **Blech Bot responds:**
   > "I've analyzed your logging feature request and found these relevant files:
   > 
   > 1. `src/utils.py` - Current error handling
   > 2. `src/config.py` - Configuration settings
   > 
   > **Recommendation:** We can implement a structured logging system using Python's `logging` module with configurable levels. Here's how we could approach this..."

4. **Automatic Implementation**
   
   **User comments:**
   > "[ develop_issue ] This looks good, please implement it"
   
   **Blech Bot creates a solution:**
   > "✅ Created branch `feature/logging-system`
   > 
   > ✅ Implemented logging with configurable levels
   > 
   > ✅ Pull request #42 is now open for review
   > 
   > The changes include a new `logger.py` module and updates to existing files to use the new logging system."

5. **Refinement Based on Feedback**
   
   **User comments on PR:**
   > "Could we add file rotation to prevent logs from growing too large?"
   
   **Blech Bot improves the solution:**
   > "Updated PR #42 with log rotation functionality:
   > - Added `TimedRotatingFileHandler`
   > - Set 7-day rotation period
   > - Configured compression for old logs
   > 
   > The changes are ready for your review."

This real-world workflow shows how Blech Bot transforms issue management into an automated, AI-powered process that saves time and improves code quality.
